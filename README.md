# link_shortener

A simple Flutter application which is able to **transform a given https link into a minimized and trackable link**.
The app **tracks a click** on such a generated link and also **redirects the user to the initial URL**.
The app provides a simple, reactive, **report view** where the user can see the number of clicks tracked per link.
